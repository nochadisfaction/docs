description: 'Build, configure, test, and deploy custom training scenarios tailored to your program objectives and trainee needs'
---

Custom scenarios allow you to create targeted training experiences that address specific competency gaps, align with your curriculum, and reflect the populations your trainees will serve. The scenario builder gives you full control over client demographics, presenting conditions, difficulty levels, cultural contexts, and therapeutic challenges.

## Scenario builder overview

Access the scenario builder from **Dashboard** → **Scenarios** → **Create new**. The builder guides you through a structured workflow to define every aspect of your training scenario.

    Publish the scenario to your organization's training library or assign it directly to trainees and groups.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring the AI client

The AI client configuration determines how the simulated client behaves during the training session. Each parameter shapes the conversation dynamics and the challenges the trainee will face.

### Demographics

Set the client's demographic profile to create realistic, diverse training experiences:

| Parameter | Options | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Age** | 13–85 years | Affects communication style, life context, and presenting concerns |
| **Gender identity** | Full spectrum including non-binary, transgender, and custom | Influences pronoun usage, identity-related concerns, and cultural context |
| **Ethnicity/Race** | Multi-select with intersectional support | Shapes cultural background, potential discrimination experiences, and worldview |
| **Socioeconomic status** | Low, working class, middle class, upper middle, high | Affects access to resources, stressors, and treatment barriers |
| **Education level** | Elementary through doctoral | Influences vocabulary, health literacy, and communication preferences |
| **Relationship status** | Single, partnered, married, divorced, widowed, other | Provides relational context for presenting concerns |
| **Occupation** | Free-text with suggested categories | Adds workplace stressors and schedule constraints |

<Tip>
  Create scenarios with demographics that represent the populations your trainees are least experienced with. This builds cultural competency where it's needed most.
</Tip>

### Presenting conditions

Choose from validated clinical presentations or create custom combinations:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mood disorders">
    Major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, bipolar I and II, cyclothymic disorder, and seasonal affective disorder. Configure severity (mild, moderate, severe), episode duration, and treatment history.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Anxiety disorders">
    Generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety, specific phobias, agoraphobia, and separation anxiety. Set trigger contexts, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptom profiles.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Trauma and stressor-related">
    PTSD, complex PTSD, acute stress disorder, and adjustment disorders. Configure trauma type, chronicity, dissociative features, and triggering stimuli within the session.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Substance use">
    Alcohol, opioid, stimulant, cannabis, and polysubstance use disorders. Set stage of change (precontemplation through maintenance), severity, and ambivalence level.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personality and relational">
    Borderline, narcissistic, avoidant, and dependent patterns. Configure interpersonal dynamics, therapeutic alliance challenges, and splitting behaviors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Crisis presentations">
    Suicidal ideation, self-harm, acute psychosis, domestic violence, and child abuse disclosure. Set urgency level and required safety interventions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom conditions">
    Define custom presentations by specifying symptoms, behaviors, cognitions, and interpersonal patterns. Use the symptom builder to create nuanced clinical pictures.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Personality and communication style

Fine-tune how the AI client communicates and interacts:

```json
{
  "personality": {
    "openness": 0.6,
    "agreeableness": 0.3,
    "emotional_expressiveness": 0.7,
    "defensiveness": 0.5,
    "insight_level": 0.4
  },
  "communication_style": {
    "verbosity": "moderate",
    "directness": "indirect",
    "emotional_vocabulary": "limited",
    "resistance_pattern": "intellectualization",
    "rapport_building_speed": "slow"
  }
}
```

Key communication parameters:

- **Verbosity** — how much the client shares without prompting (minimal, moderate, verbose)
- **Directness** — whether the client states concerns directly or communicates indirectly
- **Emotional vocabulary** — the client's ability to name and describe emotions
- **Resistance pattern** — how the client avoids difficult topics (denial, intellectualization, deflection, silence, anger)
- **Rapport building speed** — how quickly the client warms to the therapist (immediate, moderate, slow, very slow)

## Setting difficulty parameters

Difficulty configuration determines how challenging the scenario is for trainees. The platform uses a 1–10 difficulty scale with granular control over specific challenge dimensions.

### Difficulty levels

|---|---|---|
| **Session length** | Maximum duration in minutes (10, 20, 30, 45, 60) | 30 |
| **Turn limit** | Maximum number of conversational exchanges | Unlimited |
| **Available tools** | Whether the trainee can access reference materials during the session | Enabled |
| **Hint system** | Whether the platform provides guidance prompts when the trainee appears stuck | Disabled |
| **Crisis injection** | Whether the scenario can dynamically introduce a crisis moment mid-session | Off |
| **Alliance rupture** | Whether the AI client will introduce a therapeutic alliance challenge | Off |

### Scoring criteria

Customize which competency dimensions are evaluated and their relative weight:

```json
{
  "scoring": {
    "empathic_accuracy": {
      "weight": 0.30,
      "minimum_passing": 65
    },
    "bias_awareness": {
      "weight": 0.25,
      "minimum_passing": 60
    },
    "crisis_response": {
      "weight": 0.25,
      "minimum_passing": 70
    },
    "cultural_sensitivity": {
      "weight": 0.20,
      "minimum_passing": 60
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding cultural context

Cultural context adds depth and realism to scenarios by incorporating cultural factors that influence the client's experience, communication, and expectations of therapy.

### Cultural context parameters

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cultural background" icon="earth-americas">
    Define the client's cultural heritage, immigration history, acculturation level, and community ties. These factors shape how the client views mental health and help-seeking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Language and communication" icon="language">
    Set the client's primary language, English proficiency, use of idioms of distress, and culturally specific communication norms (eye contact, silence, storytelling).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Religious and spiritual context" icon="hands-praying">
    Configure the client's spiritual beliefs, religious practices, and how faith intersects with their presenting concerns and openness to treatment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Family and community dynamics" icon="people-roof">
    Define family structure, generational roles, collective vs. individualistic orientation, and community support systems.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Cultural challenge modes

Enable specific cultural competency challenges within the scenario:

- **Microaggression sensitivity** — the AI client reacts to culturally insensitive language or assumptions from the trainee
- **Idioms of distress** — the client expresses psychological distress through culture-specific physical or metaphorical language
- **Stigma barriers** — the client expresses culturally rooted shame or reluctance about mental health treatment
- **Traditional healing integration** — the client asks about incorporating traditional or alternative healing practices
- **Interpreter dynamics** — simulate sessions involving a language interpreter with associated communication challenges

<Warning>
  Cultural scenarios are developed in consultation with cultural advisors and community representatives. If you create custom cultural contexts, ensure they avoid stereotyping and reflect genuine cultural complexity. Contact your program's diversity officer for review guidance.
</Warning>

## Testing scenarios

Before deploying a scenario, test it thoroughly to ensure the AI client behaves as intended and the difficulty is calibrated appropriately.

### Test mode

Click **Test scenario** in the builder to enter test mode. In this mode:

- You play the role of the trainee and interact with the AI client
- A debug panel shows the AI client's internal state, including emotional state, resistance level, and triggered behaviors
- Competency scoring runs in real time so you can verify scoring accuracy
- You can reset and restart at any point

### Testing checklist

Use this checklist before deploying:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify client persona">
    Confirm the AI client's demographics, communication style, and presenting condition match your design. Check that the backstory is consistent and doesn't contain contradictions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test difficulty calibration">
    Run through the scenario with both strong and weak therapeutic responses. Verify that the AI client appropriately escalates resistance for poor responses and opens up for good ones.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check cultural authenticity">
    Ensure cultural elements are portrayed respectfully and accurately. Verify that cultural challenge modes trigger at appropriate moments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate scoring">
    Review the competency scores generated during your test run. Confirm that scoring weights produce appropriate differentiation between strong and weak performances.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test edge cases">
    Try unusual or off-topic responses to verify the AI client handles unexpected trainee behavior gracefully. Check crisis injection timing if enabled.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Test sessions are not counted in any analytics or reported to trainees. You can test as many times as needed without affecting your data.
