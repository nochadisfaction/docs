Effective supervision requires clear visibility into how trainees are developing over time. Pixelated Empathy provides comprehensive progress tracking tools that go beyond simple pass/fail metrics — giving you multidimensional insight into competency growth, bias reduction, and skill acquisition patterns.

## Competency scoring system

Every training session generates competency scores across five core dimensions. These scores are calculated by combining AI analysis of trainee responses with validated psychometric models.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Empathic accuracy" icon="heart">
    Measures the trainee's ability to correctly identify and reflect the client's emotional state. Scored 0–100.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bias awareness" icon="scale-balanced">
    Tracks recognition and mitigation of cognitive, cultural, and diagnostic biases during sessions. Scored 0–100.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Crisis response" icon="shield-halved">
    Evaluates appropriate identification and response to crisis signals, including safety planning and de-escalation. Scored 0–100.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cultural sensitivity" icon="globe">
    Assesses the trainee's ability to adapt therapeutic approaches across diverse cultural contexts and identities. Scored 0–100.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

A fifth composite score, **Overall clinical competency**, is a weighted average of all four dimensions. Your organization can customize the weighting to align with program priorities.

### Understanding score ranges

| Range | Level | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| 90–100 | Advanced | Consistently demonstrates expert-level skill |
| 75–89 | Proficient | Meets professional competency standards |
| 60–74 | Developing | Shows emerging skill with room for growth |
| 40–59 | Foundational | Building basic awareness; needs structured practice |
| 0–39 | Beginning | Early stage; requires intensive support and guidance |

<Tip>
  Scores reflect performance within AI-simulated scenarios, not clinical readiness. Use scores as one data point alongside your own clinical judgment and direct observation.
</Tip>

## Progress over time

The **Progress Timeline** view shows how a trainee's competency scores evolve across sessions and weeks.

### Reading the timeline

Navigate to **Trainees** → select a trainee → **Progress** to access the timeline view. The timeline displays:

- **Line chart** showing each competency dimension over time
- **Session markers** indicating when each training session occurred
- **Trend arrows** showing the direction and velocity of score changes over the last 30 days
- **Milestone markers** for significant achievements (first session above 75, longest streak, etc.)

### Time range controls

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Weekly view">
    Displays session-by-session scores for the current week. Best for identifying immediate patterns and responding to recent sessions.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Monthly view">
    Aggregates scores by week, showing rolling averages. Best for tracking steady improvement and identifying plateaus.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Program view">
    Shows the entire enrollment period from first session to present. Best for evaluating overall program impact and readiness assessments.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom range">
    Select any date range to focus on specific training periods, such as before and after a particular intervention or curriculum change.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Identifying patterns

The platform automatically detects and flags several important patterns:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Plateau detection">
    When a trainee's score in any dimension remains within a 5-point range for more than 10 sessions, the system flags a plateau. Plateaus may indicate that the trainee needs more challenging scenarios, different scenario types, or direct supervisor intervention.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regression alerts">
    A sustained drop of 10 or more points across three consecutive sessions triggers a regression alert. This could signal fatigue, personal stressors, or a need to revisit foundational concepts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Breakthrough moments">
    Sudden score jumps of 15+ points are flagged as breakthroughs. Review the associated sessions to understand what clicked — these insights can inform guidance for other trainees.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inconsistency patterns">
    High variance between sessions (scoring 85 in one session and 55 in the next) may indicate that the trainee performs well in familiar scenarios but struggles with novel situations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Comparative benchmarking

Benchmarking tools allow you to contextualize individual trainee performance against meaningful reference groups.

### Available benchmarks

| Benchmark | Description |
|---|---|
| **Cohort average** | Average scores across all trainees in the same training group |
| **Program average** | Average scores across all trainees in your organization's program |
| **National percentile** | Anonymized percentile ranking against all Pixelated Empathy users at the same training level |
| **Competency standard** | Your organization's defined minimum competency thresholds |
| **Expert baseline** | Average scores from licensed professionals completing the same scenarios |

### Using the benchmark comparison

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a trainee">
    Open the trainee's profile from your dashboard and navigate to the **Benchmarks** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose benchmarks">
    Select one or more reference benchmarks from the dropdown. You can overlay up to three benchmarks simultaneously on the chart.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare dimensions">
    The radar chart displays the trainee's scores across all competency dimensions with benchmark overlays. Gaps between the trainee's scores and the benchmark indicate areas for focused development.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Drill into specifics">
    Click any dimension on the radar chart to see a detailed breakdown of sub-competencies. For example, clicking **Bias awareness** reveals scores for confirmation bias, cultural bias, diagnostic bias, and anchoring bias.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  National percentile benchmarks are calculated from anonymized, aggregated data across all Pixelated Empathy organizations. No personally identifiable information is shared between organizations.

## Bias reduction trends

Bias reduction is a core focus of Pixelated Empathy training. The **Bias Trends** panel provides specialized analytics for tracking how trainees improve their ability to recognize and mitigate various bias types.

### Tracked bias categories

The platform monitors trainee performance across these bias categories:

- **Confirmation bias** — tendency to seek information that confirms existing beliefs about a client
- **Cultural bias** — assumptions based on a client's cultural background, ethnicity, or identity
- **Diagnostic bias** — premature diagnostic conclusions based on limited information
- **Anchoring bias** — over-reliance on first impressions or initial information
- **Gender bias** — differential treatment or assumptions based on gender identity
- **Socioeconomic bias** — assumptions or judgments based on perceived economic status
- **Age bias** — stereotyping or differential treatment based on client age

### Reading bias trend charts

Each bias category displays:

1. **Detection rate** — how often the trainee recognizes bias cues in scenarios (higher is better)
2. **Mitigation rate** — how often the trainee adjusts their response after recognizing bias (higher is better)
3. **Incident rate** — frequency of unrecognized bias instances per session (lower is better)

<Note>
  Bias detection improves nonlinearly. Trainees often see a temporary increase in detected bias as their awareness grows — this is a positive sign that they are noticing patterns they previously missed.
</Note>

### Bias reduction milestones

The platform tracks key milestones in bias reduction:

- **First recognition** — trainee's first self-correction of a biased response
- **Consistent detection** — 80%+ bias detection rate sustained over 5 sessions
- **Automatic mitigation** — trainee demonstrates bias correction without explicit prompting
- **Cross-context transfer** — bias awareness skills generalize across different scenario types

## Session frequency analytics

Session frequency and consistency are strong predictors of training outcomes. The frequency panel helps you monitor engagement patterns.

### Key frequency metrics

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Sessions per week** | Average number of completed sessions per week |
| **Streak length** | Consecutive days with at least one session |
| **Time between sessions** | Average gap between sessions (shorter is generally better for retention) |
| **Session duration** | Average time spent per session |
| **Peak training times** | Most common days and times the trainee practices |
| **Completion rate** | Percentage of started sessions that are fully completed |

### Engagement alerts

Configure automated alerts to notify you when trainees fall below engagement thresholds:

```json
{
  "alert_rules": [
    {
      "metric": "sessions_per_week",
      "threshold": 2,
      "condition": "below",
      "action": "email_supervisor"
    },
    {
      "metric": "days_since_last_session",
      "threshold": 7,
      "condition": "above",
      "action": "flag_at_risk"
    },
    {
      "metric": "completion_rate",
      "threshold": 0.5,
      "condition": "below",
      "action": "email_supervisor"
    }
  ]
}
```
