title: 'Bias Analysis API'
description: 'Analyze text for cognitive, cultural, and diagnostic biases with confidence scoring, explanations, and actionable recommendations'
---

The Bias Analysis API detects and categorizes biases in clinical text — including session notes, treatment plans, intake assessments, and real-time training conversations. Each analysis returns detected bias types, confidence scores, human-readable explanations, and specific recommendations for bias mitigation.

## Analyze text for bias

Analyze a single text input for bias indicators across all supported categories.

## Streaming analysis

For real-time applications such as live training sessions, use the streaming endpoint to receive bias analysis as text is being generated.

### `POST /v1/bias-analysis/stream`

<Note>
  **Required scope:** `bias_analysis:stream` · **Rate limit:** Standard tier · **Protocol:** Server-Sent Events (SSE)
</Note>

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.pixelatedempathy.com/v1/bias-analysis/stream \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "text": "The client is a homeless individual who seems unmotivated to change.",
    "context": "session_transcript",
    "stream": true
  }'
```

### Stream events

The endpoint returns Server-Sent Events with the following event types:

```
event: analysis_start
data: {"analysis_id": "ba_stream_001", "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:32:00Z"}

event: bias_detected
data: {"type": "socioeconomic_bias", "subtype": "labeling", "confidence": 0.81, "text_span": {"highlighted": "homeless individual"}, "explanation": "Using 'homeless' as an identity label rather than a circumstance reduces the person to their housing status."}

event: bias_detected
data: {"type": "confirmation_bias", "subtype": "motivation_assumption", "confidence": 0.74, "text_span": {"highlighted": "unmotivated to change"}, "explanation": "Characterizing the client as 'unmotivated' assumes internal deficits without exploring external barriers."}

event: analysis_complete
data: {"analysis_id": "ba_stream_001", "bias_count": 2, "overall_bias_score": 0.77, "processing_time_ms": 189}
```

<Tip>
  Use streaming analysis during live training sessions to provide real-time bias feedback. The median latency for the first `bias_detected` event is under 200ms.
</Tip>

## Supported bias types

| Bias type | Description | Example trigger |
|---|---|---|

| `diagnostic_bias` | Premature or unfounded diagnostic conclusions | "Clearly borderline" without documented criteria |
| `anchoring_bias` | Over-reliance on first impressions | Diagnosis unchanged despite contradicting evidence |
| `gender_bias` | Differential treatment based on gender | "Hysterical" applied to female clients |
| `socioeconomic_bias` | Assumptions based on economic status | "Non-compliant" linked to insurance type |
| `age_bias` | Stereotyping based on age | "Confused elderly patient" without assessment |

## Error responses

| Status | Error code | Description |
|---|---|---|
