### Breach Assessment

Every potential breach is evaluated using a four-factor risk assessment:

1. **Nature and extent** of PHI involved (types and identifiers)
2. **Unauthorized person** who accessed or received the PHI
3. **Whether PHI was actually acquired or viewed** (vs. opportunity only)
4. **Extent of risk mitigation** applied after discovery

<Warning>
  Low-probability exceptions (unintentional access, good faith internal disclosure, limited inadvertent disclosure) are documented but do **not** eliminate the breach assessment requirement.
</Warning>

### Notification Requirements

| Audience | Threshold | Deadline | Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Affected Individuals** | Any confirmed breach | 60 days | First-class mail or email |
| **Prominent Media** | 500+ individuals in a state | 60 days | Press release |
| **HHS Secretary** | Any confirmed breach | 60 days (or annual log for <500) | Electronic submission |
