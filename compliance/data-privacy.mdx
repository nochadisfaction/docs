description: "Privacy-first architecture, PII handling, patient rights, consent framework, data retention policies, and GDPR considerations for Pixelated Empathy."
---

Privacy is not a feature of Pixelated Empathy — it is a **foundational architectural constraint**. Every system, pipeline, and data flow is designed with the assumption that therapeutic data is among the most sensitive information a person can share. We protect it accordingly.

<Note>
  **Privacy Officer:** [privacy@pixelatedempathy.com](mailto:privacy@pixelatedempathy.com)
  **Data Protection Officer (GDPR):** [dpo@pixelatedempathy.com](mailto:dpo@pixelatedempathy.com)

  Pixelated Empathy does **not** sell, rent, or trade personal information or PHI. Ever.
</Note>

## Privacy-First Architecture

Pixelated Empathy implements a **zero-knowledge-oriented** architecture where the platform minimizes its own access to identifiable information. Privacy controls are enforced at the infrastructure level, not just the application level.

  <Card title="End-to-End Encryption" icon="lock">
    All data encrypted with AES-256-GCM at rest and TLS 1.3 in transit. PHI is encrypted at the application layer *before* reaching the database — even database administrators cannot read raw PHI.

  <Card title="PII Filtering at Ingestion" icon="filter">
    The GeminiMem0Manager filters all PII from data before it enters the AI memory system. Names, emails, phone numbers, SSNs, and other identifiers are scrubbed or replaced with anonymized placeholders.

  <Card title="Anonymized Identifiers" icon="fingerprint">
    Internal systems reference users by anonymized IDs only. No human-readable names, emails, or other PII appear in logs, monitoring dashboards, error reports, or internal documentation.

    Every data access is scoped to the minimum information required for the specific operation. Role-based access controls enforce this at the API, database, and service layers.

## PII Handling

### GeminiMem0Manager PII Filtering

The GeminiMem0Manager serves as the privacy gateway between user interactions and the AI memory system. It ensures that **no personally identifiable information is ever stored in AI memory**.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="How It Works">
    Before any conversation data enters the memory system:

    1. **Detection:** Multi-pattern PII scanner identifies names, emails, phone numbers, SSNs, addresses, dates of birth, medical record numbers, and financial data
    2. **Classification:** Each detected PII element is classified by type and confidence score
    3. **Replacement:** PII is replaced with type-specific placeholders (`[NAME]`, `[EMAIL]`, `[PHONE]`, etc.)
    4. **Verification:** Post-scrub verification confirms no PII patterns remain
    5. **Audit:** The scrubbing operation is logged (without the original PII values)

    ```python
    # PII categories detected and scrubbed
    class PIICategory(str, Enum):
        NAMES = "names"          # Dr. John Smith → [NAME]
        EMAILS = "emails"        # john@example.com → [EMAIL]
        PHONES = "phones"        # (555) 123-4567 → [PHONE]
        ADDRESSES = "addresses"  # 123 Main St → [ADDRESS]
        SSN = "ssn"              # 123-45-6789 → [SSN]
        DATES = "dates"          # 01/15/1990 → [DATE]
        FINANCIAL = "financial"  # 4111-1111-1111-1111 → [FINANCIAL]
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="What Gets Stored">
    The AI memory system retains only **therapeutic context** — never identity:

    | Stored | NOT Stored |
    |---|---|
    | Emotional patterns and themes | Names or identifiers |
    | Therapeutic progress signals | Contact information |
    | Coping strategies discussed | Physical addresses |
    | Session context and continuity | Social Security numbers |
    | Cultural adaptation preferences | Medical record numbers |
    | Crisis history (anonymized) | Financial information |

    <Warning>
      If the PII scrubber detects information it cannot confidently classify, it defaults to **scrubbing** rather than retaining. False positives (over-scrubbing) are preferred over false negatives (PII leakage).
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Scanning Capabilities">
    The PII scanner uses multi-layered detection:

    - **Regex patterns:** High-confidence detection of structured PII (SSN, phone, email, credit card)
    - **Named Entity Recognition:** ML-based detection of names, addresses, and organizations
    - **Contextual analysis:** Identifies PII that appears in unstructured text (e.g., "my therapist Dr. Smith" or "I live on Main Street")
    - **Custom patterns:** Healthcare-specific patterns (MRN numbers, patient IDs, provider IDs)

    ```python
    def scan_for_pii(text: str) -> dict:
        """Scans text for PII without modifying it."""
        result = {
            "found": False,
            "categories": [],
            "count": 0,
        }
        for category, patterns in PII_PATTERNS.items():
            for pattern in patterns:
                matches = pattern.findall(text)
                if matches:
                    result["found"] = True
                    result["categories"].append(category.value)
                    result["count"] += len(matches)
        return result
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### PII in Logs and Documentation

<Warning>
  **Absolute rule: No PII in logs, documentation, error reports, or monitoring systems.**

  - Application logs reference anonymized user IDs only (`usr_a1b2c3d4`)
  - Error reports are scrubbed before transmission to error tracking services
  - Monitoring dashboards display aggregated, de-identified metrics
  - Internal documentation uses placeholder data exclusively
  - Code comments and examples never contain real user data
</Warning>

## Consent Framework

Pixelated Empathy implements a **granular, layered consent model** that gives users meaningful control over how their data is processed.

### Consent Principles

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Informed" icon="circle-info">
    All consent requests use plain, understandable language. Each request clearly states the purpose, scope, and consequences of granting or withholding consent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Explicit" icon="check-double">
    Active opt-in required — no pre-checked boxes or implied consent. Users must take affirmative action for each consent category.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Granular" icon="sliders">
    Separate consent for separate purposes. Users can consent to core services while declining research participation or marketing communications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Revocable" icon="rotate-left">
    Users can withdraw any consent at any time through their privacy dashboard. Withdrawal takes effect immediately for new data processing.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Consent Categories

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Required Consents">
    These consents are necessary for service delivery:

    | Consent | Purpose | Legal Basis | Withdrawable |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | **Service Consent** | Core therapeutic AI service delivery | Contractual necessity | No (service terminates) |
    | **Privacy Policy** | Acknowledgment of data practices | Legal requirement | No (account deletion required) |
    | **HIPAA Authorization** | Use and disclosure of PHI | HIPAA Privacy Rule | Yes (30-day notice, account closure) |
